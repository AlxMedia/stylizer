== Description ==

Stylizer is a flexible blog theme with plenty of options and a unique look. This theme will handle text-only posts brilliantly - your blog posts will look good even though you have no images to show. It includes things such as unlimited accent colors, a sidebar to the right or no sidebar at all, any site width, a standard or list blog layout, a switch that can be enabled to change between day and night mode and much more. 

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the 'Add New' button.
2. Type in Stylizer in the search form and press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
3. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
4. Navigate to Appearance > Customize in your admin panel and customize to taste.
